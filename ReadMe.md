This Shiny App is for predicting miles per gallon(mpg).
The dataset is from mtcars in R. This data frame has 32 observations on 11 variables.
<br><br>
The prediction algorithm use three predictors qsec(1/4 mile time), am Transmission(0=automatic, 1=manul) and wt(Weight) to predict mpg.
<br><br>
By choosing your 1/4 mile time (in Seconds), checking whether your car is on manual transmission and entering your car weight (in 1000lbs), you can click submit and get your prediction result in the main panel.
<br><br>
For example, if your car takes 15 seconds per 1/4 mile, uses automatic transmission and weigh 3500lbs, you can input these values and get the prediction result which is around 14.3 miles per gallon
